## Project Overview

The Graph Theory Application is an interactive, educational tool designed to support the creation, visualization, and manipulation of graphs. It integrates a suite of graph algorithms and visualization tools to make complex concepts accessible and engaging.

## Features

- **Graph Creation & Manipulation**: Interactive creation of vertices and edges.
- **Core Algorithms**:
  - **Welsh-Powell Graph Coloring**: Step-by-step animation of graph coloring.
  - **Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree**: Visualizes MST construction.
  - **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path**: Shortest path calculation and visualization.
  - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Handles graphs with negative weights.
- **Stable Set Calculation**: Compute maximal stable sets.
